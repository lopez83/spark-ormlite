<b>Ladder Rules</b>
<ol>
<li>All Ladder matches will be best of 3 games played to 11.</li>
<li>You may challenge any of the 3 people ahead of you on the ladder.</li>
<li>Challenges may be made verbally or by email, but you must declare it before the match begins.</li>
<li>Once a match has completed, you may not challenge the same person again for 48 hours.</li>
<li>After a challenge has been issued, an effort should be made to play the match within 72 hours.</li>
</ol>
<b>Playing The Game</b>
<br>
A game is started when one player (server) makes a service before the receiver makes the return.  The Server should:<br>
<ul>
<li>start with the ball resting freely on an open palm.</li>
<li>project the ball near vertically upwards, without imparting spin, so that it rises at least 16cm.</li>
<li>strike the ball so that it touches first his/her court and then, after passing over the net assembly, touches directly the receiver's court. In doubles, the ball must touch successively the right half court of server and receiver.</li>
<li>Once the ball has been served, both players are to make returns until a point is scored. In doubles, each player on the same team must take turns to make the return.</li>
</ul>
After 2 points have been scored, the receiving player/pair shall become the serving player/pair and so on until the end of the game.
<br><br>
<b>Scoring</b>
<br>
A game is won when one of the players scores 11 points. In the event that both players score 10 points, a game is be won by the first player to gain a 2-point lead. A full match is won when a player or pair wins the best of any odd number of games (3,5,7).  A point is scored when:<br>
<ol>
<li>an opponent fails to make a correct service,</li>
<li>an opponent fails to make a return,</li>
<li>the ball touches any part of an opponent’s body,</li>
